# Runge-Kutta-odometric-localization-method and posture regulator based on polar coordinates
Implement via software the unicycle posture regulator based on polar coordinates, with the state feedback computed through the Runge-Kutta odometric localization method.
The robot must be brought from $q_i$= [5 2 $\pi \over 2$ $]^T$, to the origin.

 In the pdf: "Runge-Kutta odometry localization.pdf" the analysis made is explained in detail.
